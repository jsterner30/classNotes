This Rule (Irenaeus claimed) is what the bishops teach now and therefore comes down from the apostles. In content it is akin to the formulas used in the questions put to candi­ dates for baptism and is simply the credal pattern based on the New Testament. Tertullian treated it as independent of Scripture because, in argument with heretics, it was a better defence than the Bible, over the interpretation ofwhich one can argue long with the sole effect of bewildering simple
folk who want a short and direct answer. Tertullian argued that the Bible is often difficult to interpret. Obscure passages must be interpreted by those which are plain. Moreover, the
Bible is old. To appeal to the Rule of Faith is to appeal to what is now being taught by the churches of apostolic foun­ dation. So Tertullian, following Irenaeus before him but going considerably further, seems here to have distinguished between Scripture and Tradition almost as if they were distinct sources of revelation. Nevertheless, Tertullian was also well aware that the Rule of Faith is derived from Scrip­ ture: for him to say that the Rule is the key for interpreting the Bible is no different from saying that obscure passages must be interpreted by the clear. The argument is of course circular: the tradition of Church teaching must be proved orthodox by the biblical revelation; yet doubtful books are admitted to the New Testament canon because they are orthodox by the standards of Church tradition, and only the tradition can ensure that the interpretation o f Scripture is sound.
FORMS OF THE MINISTRY
The apostles derived their name and function from the fact of being sent by the Lord as missionaries. They were not the only ones to receive gifts of the Spirit. There were also 'prophets’, like Agabus (Acts xi, 28; xxi, 7), and teachers, accredited as instructors in the faith. At Corinth the Church especially prized the gift of ecstatic irrational utterance (‘speaking with tongues'). Paul could not afford to deny that the gift of ecstasy was a genuine manifestation of the Spirit, but was alarmed by its divisive possibilities (1 Cor.
46 Faith and Order
xiii) and told the Corinthians that the enthusiastic utterance they especially prized was the last in the graded hierarchy of supernatural gifts: it is preceded by ‘first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, next miracle-workers, then healers, helpers, and administrators’ (i Cor. xii, 28). The first three in this sevenfold hierarchy are the chief ‘ orders * of the first missionary generation.
Sixty or seventy years later Ignatius was speaking of Antioch and the Asian churches as possessing a monarchical bishop, together with presbyters and deacons. In his time there were neither apostles nor prophets. The exact history of this transition within two generations from apostles, prophets and teachers to bishop, presbyters and deacons is shrouded in obscurity, though our sources give occasional glimpses ofthe process. The epistle ofClement ofRome to the Corinthians implies the existence of two distinct orders of ministry, bishops or presbyters (the titles are applied to the same people) and deacons. This twofold order is also apparent in the New Testament: Paul addresses his Philippian epistle to the ‘ bishops and deacons Later New Testament writings
(Acts xx, 17; Titus i, 5-7) likewise illustrate the application of* presbyter' and *bishop ’ to the same person. Evidently the churches established by the travelling missionaries soon came to have local, stationary clergy, subordinate to the general oversight ofmobile apostolic authority. For a genera­ tion or more the apostles and prophets coexisted with this local ministry of bishops and deacons. This situation is in fact reflected in the Didache or ‘ Teaching o f the Apostles',1 a document reckoned as Scripture by many early Fathers but which disappeared until 1883 when Archbishop Bryen- nios printed it from a manuscript, now at Jerusalem, dated 1056. The text may have suffered some revision over the centuries before this date. From the beginning the Didache was a composite work, made up of bits and pieces. Its date and purpose have been much debated, and because of the mistaken opinion that it is dependent on the Epistle of Barnabas (probably an Alexandrian work of about 130-40) it has often been thought to be a late fiction. But the situation

Please note: Any information found on page 113 in regard to Origen’s views on the Trinity may appear as questions on an exam.
Origen had been deeply opposed to Monarchianism, either in its ‘modalist’ form that Father, Son, and Spirit are mere names which do not correspond to any distinctions within the Godhead, or in its ‘ dynamic’ form that Christ was a holy man and wise teacher filled to a unique degree with the Spirit ofGod. For Origen Christ is the pre-existent Logos, the mediator through whom Christians are taught to pray
to the Father. That this is no heresy Origen proved by appeal­ ing to the tradition of the church that the great prayer or ‘anaphora’oftheeucharistisaddressedtotheFatherthrough the Son. Therefore a distinction o f some kind must be affir­ med. Origen explained that while the Father and the Son are one in power and will, they are two distinct realities - they differ, he said, in hypostasis. They are distinct as archetype and flawless image. This is reconciled with monotheism by allowing that the Son is in some sense subordinate to the Father, as a lower level of ‘being’ within the Godhead. Origen did not think that the divine Logos belonged to the created order. The Son is begotten, not made, and his genera­ tion is eternal, not in time. Yet he is the mediator between the Supreme Father and this created world, as a high priest between God and man, representing each to the other.
