This Rule (Irenaeus claimed) is what the bishops teach now and therefore comes down from the apostles. In content it is akin to the formulas used in the questions put to candi­ dates for baptism and is simply the credal pattern based on the New Testament. Tertullian treated it as independent of Scripture because, in argument with heretics, it was a better defence than the Bible, over the interpretation ofwhich one can argue long with the sole effect of bewildering simple
folk who want a short and direct answer. Tertullian argued that the Bible is often difficult to interpret. Obscure passages must be interpreted by those which are plain. Moreover, the
Bible is old. To appeal to the Rule of Faith is to appeal to what is now being taught by the churches of apostolic foun­ dation. So Tertullian, following Irenaeus before him but going considerably further, seems here to have distinguished between Scripture and Tradition almost as if they were distinct sources of revelation. Nevertheless, Tertullian was also well aware that the Rule of Faith is derived from Scrip­ ture: for him to say that the Rule is the key for interpreting the Bible is no different from saying that obscure passages must be interpreted by the clear. The argument is of course circular: the tradition of Church teaching must be proved orthodox by the biblical revelation; yet doubtful books are admitted to the New Testament canon because they are orthodox by the standards of Church tradition, and only the tradition can ensure that the interpretation o f Scripture is sound.
FORMS OF THE MINISTRY
The apostles derived their name and function from the fact of being sent by the Lord as missionaries. They were not the only ones to receive gifts of the Spirit. There were also 'prophets’, like Agabus (Acts xi, 28; xxi, 7), and teachers, accredited as instructors in the faith. At Corinth the Church especially prized the gift of ecstatic irrational utterance (‘speaking with tongues'). Paul could not afford to deny that the gift of ecstasy was a genuine manifestation of the Spirit, but was alarmed by its divisive possibilities (1 Cor.
46 Faith and Order
xiii) and told the Corinthians that the enthusiastic utterance they especially prized was the last in the graded hierarchy of supernatural gifts: it is preceded by ‘first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, next miracle-workers, then healers, helpers, and administrators’ (i Cor. xii, 28). The first three in this sevenfold hierarchy are the chief ‘ orders * of the first missionary generation.
Sixty or seventy years later Ignatius was speaking of Antioch and the Asian churches as possessing a monarchical bishop, together with presbyters and deacons. In his time there were neither apostles nor prophets. The exact history of this transition within two generations from apostles, prophets and teachers to bishop, presbyters and deacons is shrouded in obscurity, though our sources give occasional glimpses ofthe process. The epistle ofClement ofRome to the Corinthians implies the existence of two distinct orders of ministry, bishops or presbyters (the titles are applied to the same people) and deacons. This twofold order is also apparent in the New Testament: Paul addresses his Philippian epistle to the ‘ bishops and deacons Later New Testament writings
(Acts xx, 17; Titus i, 5-7) likewise illustrate the application of* presbyter' and *bishop ’ to the same person. Evidently the churches established by the travelling missionaries soon came to have local, stationary clergy, subordinate to the general oversight ofmobile apostolic authority. For a genera­ tion or more the apostles and prophets coexisted with this local ministry of bishops and deacons. This situation is in fact reflected in the Didache or ‘ Teaching o f the Apostles',1 a document reckoned as Scripture by many early Fathers but which disappeared until 1883 when Archbishop Bryen- nios printed it from a manuscript, now at Jerusalem, dated 1056. The text may have suffered some revision over the centuries before this date. From the beginning the Didache was a composite work, made up of bits and pieces. Its date and purpose have been much debated, and because of the mistaken opinion that it is dependent on the Epistle of Barnabas (probably an Alexandrian work of about 130-40) it has often been thought to be a late fiction. But the situation

Please note: Any information found on page 113 in regard to Origen’s views on the Trinity may appear as questions on an exam.
Origen had been deeply opposed to Monarchianism, either in its ‘modalist’ form that Father, Son, and Spirit are mere names which do not correspond to any distinctions within the Godhead, or in its ‘ dynamic’ form that Christ was a holy man and wise teacher filled to a unique degree with the Spirit ofGod. For Origen Christ is the pre-existent Logos, the mediator through whom Christians are taught to pray
to the Father. That this is no heresy Origen proved by appeal­ ing to the tradition of the church that the great prayer or ‘anaphora’oftheeucharistisaddressedtotheFatherthrough the Son. Therefore a distinction o f some kind must be affir­ med. Origen explained that while the Father and the Son are one in power and will, they are two distinct realities - they differ, he said, in hypostasis. They are distinct as archetype and flawless image. This is reconciled with monotheism by allowing that the Son is in some sense subordinate to the Father, as a lower level of ‘being’ within the Godhead. Origen did not think that the divine Logos belonged to the created order. The Son is begotten, not made, and his genera­ tion is eternal, not in time. Yet he is the mediator between the Supreme Father and this created world, as a high priest between God and man, representing each to the other.

Chap 8

T h e conversion of Constantine marks a turning-point in the history of the Church and of Europe. It meant much more than the end of persecution. The sovereign auto­ crat was inevitably and immediately involved in the develop­ ment of the church, and conversely the Church became more and more implicated in high political decisions. It is char­ acteristic that the Western attitude towards the conversion of Constantine and its consequences has generally been more ambivalent than the Eastern. In the West there has been a sharper consciousness of the double-sidedness of his benefits to the Church. But if his conversion should not be interpreted as an inward experience of grace, neither was it a cynical act of Machiavellian cunning. It was a military matter. His comprehension of Christian doctrine was never very clear, but he was sure that victory in battle lay in the gift of the God of the Christians. In 312 with inferior forces and against all prudence he made a rapid invasion of Italy and attacked his rival Maxentius in Rome. Instead of re­ maining secure behind Aurelian’s walls, Maxentius chose to come out and fight with the Tiber behind him. It was such unaccountable folly that Constantine’svictory at the Milvian Bridge (312) seemed a signal manifestation of celestial favour. The Roman senate erected in his honour the Arch that stands today by the Colosseum, depicting the drowning of Maxentius’ troops and proclaiming in its inscription that Constantine won ‘by the prompting of the deity’. The deity to whom they referred was the Unconquered Sun.
The Christians believed the one God whom they wor­ shipped had given Constantine victory. Lactantius, the
126 Constantine and the Council o f Nicaea
Latin apologist who taught rhetoric at Nicomedia in Asia Minor, tells of a dream granted to Constantine directing him to put the ‘Chi-Rho’ monogram f on his shields and standards as a talisman of victory. The sign, which appears on Constantine’s coins from 315, was a monogram of the
name of Christ. Late fourth-century writers called it the ‘ labarum5. Its name and shape might suggest an echo of the double-axe (labrys) which was an ancient cult-symbol of Zeus. But that its meaning was universally understood to be Christian is shown by the fact that under Julian it was abol­ ished. Perhaps Constantine decided to make the Christian
monogram his military standard even prior to 312, Before a battle against invading barbarians (he told Eusebius of Caesarea many years later) he had seen the cross athwart the midday sun inscribed with the words ‘By this conquer*. The occasion may have been during his campaign against the Franks near Autun in 311; a contemporary pagan orator mentions a vision of the Sun-god on the eve of his victory on this occasion.
In other words, Constantine was not aware of any mutual exclusiveness between Christianity and his faith in the Un­ conquered Sun, The transition from solar monotheism (the most popular form of contemporary paganism) to Chris­ tianity was not difficult. In Old Testament prophecy Christ was entitled ‘ the sun of righteousness5. Clement of Alexan­

the sky like the Sun-god. A tomb mosaic recently found at

Rome, probably made early in the fourth century, depicts Christ as the Sun-god mounting the heavens with his chariot. Tertullian says that many pagans imagined the Christians worshipped the sun because they met on Sundays and prayed towards the East. Moreover, early in the fourth century there begins in the West (where first and by whom is not known) the celebration o f 25 December, the birthday o f the Sun-god at the winter solstice, as the date for the nativity of Christ. How easy it was for Christianity and solar religion to become entangled at the popular level is strikingly illu­ strated by a mid-fifth century sermon of Pope Leo the Great, rebuking his over-cautious flock for paying reverence to the

Constantine and the Council o f Nicaea 127
Sun on the steps of St Peter’s before turning their back on it to worship inside the westward-facing basilica.1
I f Constantine’s coins long continued to be engraved with the symbolic representation of the Sun, his letters from 313 onwards leave no doubt that he regarded himself as a Chris­ tian whose imperial duty it was to keep a united Church. He was not baptized until he lay dying in 337, but this implies no doubt about his Christian belief. It was common at this
time (and continued so until about a
baptism to the end of one’s life, especially if one’s duty as an official included torture and execution ofcriminals. Part of the reason for postponement lay in the seriousness with which the responsibilities of baptism were taken. Constantine favoured Christianity among the many religions of his sub­
jects, but did not make it the official o r *established ’ religion of the empire.
When in obedience to a divinely granted dream he de­ cided to found a new capital for the eastern halfofthe empire at the magnificent strategic site of Byzantium on the Bos­ phorus, he intended it to be a ‘ New Rome ’, providing it with two noble churches dedicated to the Apostles and to Peace
(Irene).3But he also placed in the forum a statue of the Sun- god bearing his own features, and even found room for a statue of the mother-goddess Cybele.® The ‘ genius’ of the city he solemnly invoked with a celebration conducted by Christian clergy on 11 May 330.

new copies of the Bible and by building churches, especially the basilicas in Rome at the traditional shrines ofSt Peter and St Paul and in the Holy Land at Bethlehem and the Holy Sepulchre. The palace ofhis second wife Fausta, formerly the property of the Lateran family, he gave to the bishops of Rome as an episcopal residence (which it remained until 1308). He even assigned a fixed proportion of provincial
revenues to church charity, so large that even when cut to a third at its restoration after the suspension under Julian’s pagan revival, it was reckoned generous. Constantine also endeavoured to express Christian ideals in some o f his laws, protecting children, slaves, peasants and prisoners. An edict
of 316 directs that criminals may not be branded on the face ‘ because man is made in God’s image \
A law of Constantine of 321 closed law courts ‘on the venerable day of the sun' except for the pious purpose of freeing slaves, and deprecated Sunday labour except where necessary on farms. An inscription found near Zagreb records that Constantine changed the old custom of working for seven days and holding a market-day every eighth, directing farmers to hold their market-day each Sunday. This is the earliest evidence for the process by which Sunday became not merely the day on which Christians met for worship but also a day of rest, and it is noteworthy that in both law and inscription Constantine’s stated motive for introducing this
custom is respect for the sun.
The Christian practice of commemorating the Lord’s
resurrection on the first day of the week was already tradi­ tional before St Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. The Church de­ rived the habit ofworship on one day in seven fromJudaism, not from Mithraic sun-cult, and they chose Sunday as the day when the Lord rose again. But popular astrology from

Constantine and the Council o fJficaea 129
the day of light and sun. Accordingly the institution of the week, unknown to the classical age, was gradually diffused by popular astrology and derived a little additional impetus from the spread of Christianity. The Church tried to replace the pagan names for the days by numerical terms, and in the Greek East succeeded, but in the less Christianized West the planetary names could not be eliminated and now survive in all West European languages except Portuguese.
By 321 Constantine’s faith had become a political factor. His eastern colleague Licinius (with whom he had agreed on religious toleration in 313) was a pagan, and as suspicion of each other’s intentions rose Constantine tried to enlist Christian support in the East. He succeeded in encircling Licinius by making alliance with the Armenians who had recently become Christians. When Licinius harried Christ­ ians near the Armenian frontier and prohibited synods,
Constantine had an excuse for a crusading war culminating in a victory on the Bosphorus in September 324 which left him sole ruler.
Constantine’s move to the East brought him to the centre of gravity of the empire. He also desired to visit the Holy Land and expressed a wish to be baptized in Jordan. But his expectation o f the Christian East was sadly disappointed.
Just as the Donatist controversy in Africa had distressed him in the West, so now he found that the Greek churches had just become involved in sharp dissension, originating in an abstruse disagreement between bishop Alexander of Alex­ andria and his presbyter Arius. It had started as a local quarrel. But Arius had invoked weighty support outside Egypt, and now Alexander ofAlexandria was being opposed
by important bishops like the learned historian, Eusebius of Palestinian Caesarea, and his powerful namesake Eusebius bishop of Nicomedia, the imperial residence in Bithynia. The Greek episcopate was split into two parties, with feeling running high. Constantine at once abandoned his proposed pilgrimage; he sent his ecclesiastical adviser, Hosius, bishop o f Cordova, on a mission o f reconciliation and inquiry, and decided to call a vast council ofbishops at Ancyra (Ankara) after Easter 325.

130 Constantine and the Council o f Nicaea
On arrival at Alexandria Hosius sided with Alexander against Arms, and then went to Antioch in Syria to inquire into the support which Arius had been receiving from Eusebius of Caesarea and others. At a council of Antioch, where Hosius presided, Eusebius was excommunicated — subject to confirmation by the great council already called for Ancyra. It was a clear attempt to prejudge the issue, and Constantine reacted at once by transferring the council
from Ancyra (Ankara) to Nicaea (Iznik) near Nicomedia so that he could personally control the proceedings.
The Council of Nicaea, soon to be reckoned the first ‘ ecumenical’ or world council because of the range of repre­ sentation there, was attended by about 220 bishops, almost all Greek. Only four or five came from the Latin West apart from Hosius of Cordova and two Roman presbyters sent by Pope Silvester. Nevertheless, it was a notable event for the church and was felt to be so at the time. At the solemn opening on 20 May 325 Constantine urged the bishops to achieve unity and peace. He quickly made it clear that he deplored the censure of Eusebius of Caesarea and declared full support for his doctrines. But Eusebius’ vindication did not mean that his friend Arius was to be upheld. The creed proposed for adoption by the council was sharply anti-Arian in its affirma­ tion that the Son is ‘of one substance with the Father’. Its concluding anathema condemned the propositions that the Son is metaphysically or morally inferior to the Father and belongs to the created order. Astonishingly enough, after the strong partisanship apparent before the council, 218 out of 220 bishops signed the creed, a unanimity that must cer­ tainly have gratified the anxious emperor. It is, however, clear that the crucial terms o f the creed were not understood in a precisely identical sense by all the signatories. ‘ O f one
substance ’ (homoousios) affirmed identity. It declared that the Father and the Son are ‘ the same’. But this was ambiguous. To some it meant a personal or specific identity; to many others it meant a much broader, generic identity. The happy accident of this ambiguity enabled Constantine to secure
the assent of everyone except two Libyan bishops, whose objections seem to have been less to the creed than to


Chap 9

After the deadlock at Serdica reunion was achieved, under the strongest imperial pressure, only by painful and un­ acknowledged sacrifices on either side. The East agreed to take back Athanasius at Alexandria, while the West silently dropped the cause of Marcellus of Ancyra. Athanasius re­ entered Alexandria in 346 to an enthusiastic welcome, and
for the next ten years enjoyed his longest single period of uninterrupted possession of his see. The tacit agreement on reunion was only a truce, however. In 350 Constans fell before the usurper Magnentius in Gaul. Constantius refused to recognize Magnentius, and bloody civil war followed in which the decisive victory was won by Constantius at Mursa. In a chapel near the battle none prayed more fervently for Constantius’ victory than the Arian bishop of Mursa, Valens, and from this time onwards Valens became a potent adviser of the emperor in church matters. Valens was ve­ hemently opposed to Athanasius, and Constantius was now sole emperor.
Athanasius’ periods of exile had enabled him to build up solid and entrenched support in the West. It was clear to Constantius that the West was the citadel which must be brought to condemn Athanasius, and the process would not be very difficult since many Western bishops had only the haziest idea of what the controversy was really about.1 At successive synods summoned at Arles (353) and Milan (355) Constantius extracted from pliant bishops a condemnation o f Athanasius. Exile was imposed on the few who refused - Lucifer of Calaris (Sardinia), Eusebius of Vercellae, Diony­ siusofMilan (whowasreplacedbythesafeArianAuxentius), Hilary of Poitiers, and above all the bishop of Rome, Liber- ius, who had succeeded Julius in 352.
Not until the submission of the West was secure did the storm finally break on Athanasius in Egypt, though it had long been clear to him what was coming, and he made good preparations. In February 356 it took a military force to oust him and to install an Arian successor, named George,

   who conspicuously failed to endear himself to the Alex­ andrians (below, p. 155). Athanasius fled to the desert - to the monks with whom he always stood in the closest sympathy - and successfully evaded all attempts to find him. From his hiding-place he poured out vitriolic pamphlets against Constantius and his Arian advisers, painting a lurid picture ofthe sufferings being endured by the orthodox under
   the current regime. It is some measure of the almost mono­ lithic support he now enjoyed in Egypt that he was never betrayed to the vigilant authorities.
   George ofAlexandria was a radical Arian. During 357 the great see of Antioch also fell into the hands of a likeminded radical, Eudoxius. The occupation of these crucially impor­ tant sees by extreme Arians caused great alarm in the Greek East. The language of these men was unmarked by conces­ sions to religious devotion or doctrinal tradition. Their approach to religion was influenced by a clever Antiochene layman, Aetius, expert in logic. He used to argue relent­ lessly that the principles both o f monotheism and o f divine impassibility could only be consistently maintained if one frankly asserted that the Son is not merely distinct from the Father but actually belongs to the created order; that all derived being is substantially dissimilar from the imderived First Cause; in short, that the Son’s essence is unlike (ano-
   moios) the Father’s.This position,quickly labelled Anomoean or ‘dissimilarian’, was opposed not merely to the Nicene formula that the essence o f the Father and the Son is identical (homoousios), but also to the predominant formula of the great majority of Greek bishops that the Son’s essence is ‘like’ the Father’s (homoiousios) as a perfect image resembles its archetype. This homoiousios formula seemed to possess the attractions that it affirmed the highest degree o f resem­ blance short of that ‘ identity of essence* which, under the
   umbrella of the Nicene creed, could give dangerous protec­ tion to ‘ Sabellians* like Marcellus o f Ancyra.
   The enthusiastic advocacy of Dissimilarian theology by Eudoxius of Antioch caused consternation among those many bishops who belonged to the ‘central’ conservative tradition represented by the homoiousios formula that the

Son’s essence is like the Father’s. Their leader in 357-8 was Basil, bishop of Ancyra (Marcellus’ successor), an ascetic to whom Eudoxius and George ofAlexandria appeared irrelig­ ious men bent on the shipwreck of the church. Basil knew his way about the imperial court and forthwith hastened to Constantius at Sirmium (Mitrovica in Yugoslavia). He suc­ cessfully persuaded Constantius that homoiousios was the only formula capable of maintaining both unity in the church and the true faith. For a time Basil of Ancyra succeeded in holding the emperor’s confidence and in ousting the
Arianizing Valens of Mursa, who had effectively dominated Constantius’ mind on church questions for the preceding six years. Only a few months previously Valens had had his supreme triumph in gaining the submission of none other than Hosius of Cordova, the veteran of Nicaea, to a creed which deplored both the Nicene ‘ identity of essence’ and Basil of Ancyra’s *likeness of essence’ as unscriptural for­ mulas which disturbed the faithful and made assertions beyond human knowledge. But Valens had failed to gain the assent ofthe exiled Liberius ofRome to this creed. Liber- ius, however, felt no comparable objections to the doctrine ofBasilofAncyra;andonhisassenttoBasil’sformula (which enhanced Basil’s authority) Constantius allowed him to return to Rome in 358.
For a year Valens of Mursa and Basil ofAncyra competed for the emperor’s favour. Valens wanted to say no more than the Son is ‘like’ the Father, without using the trouble­ some word ‘ essence ’ (ousia). Basil saw that so vague a formula left the gate open to an Arian flood, and insisted that one must affirm the Son’s essential likeness to the Father. In
359 Constantius decided to hold a grand universal council of East and West, divided for convenience into two parts, the West to meet in Italy at Rimini, the East at Seleucia
(Silifke) near the south coast of Asia Minor. The division was fatal to Basil’s cause. Valens was able to bring the Western representatives to an abject surrender to Constantius’ will, and once the West had failed to stand firm for its tradition it was easy work for Eudoxius of Antioch and George of

Alexandria to crush altogether Basil’s hope of retaining the

emperor's support. In 360 Eudoxius was translated from Antioch to Constantinople; and at a council there, gathered to celebrate the dedication of the new church of Holy Wisdom, Sancta Sophia, a creed was formally promulgated that the Son is ‘ like ’ the Father without further qualification.
As Jerome wrote o f the council o f R im in i,' the world groaned to find itselfArian’.
T o all outward appearance the confused intrigues o f 357-60 had ended in an almost complete victory for Arian­ ism. The extreme Arian Aetius, who could not conscien­ tiously bring himself to say that the Son was even ‘ like* the Father, was exiled, but he was of no real consequence. The agony of 360 was the crushing defeat of Basil of Ancyra and his friends, many o f whom were deposed from their sees and exiled. Yet the consistent, overruling objective of Constan­ tius' church policy was to find a formula on which the largest possible number could agree. Constantius was persuaded by
Valens of Mursa that the right recipe for a united church throughout the empire was an imprecise and broad defini­ tion. The emperor was convinced by plentiful evidence that the old Nicene formula o f 325, with which his father had had extraordinary success, was a cause o f sharp disputes and not at all conducive to peace. It seemed sensible, therefore, to propose for everyone’s assent a simpler creed which avoided unscriptural words, which did not make assertions about matters God had not thought fit to reveal, and which was
sufficiently wide to comprehend everybody but the intran­ sigent extremists on either side.
There were, however, difficulties about this policy, in­ herent in its nature. Constantius wanted the vague formula o f ‘ likeness' because it seemed politically expedient for the welfare of the empire. The dissensions of the Christians were not a matter to be regarded with amused indifference or sad resignation. They were a political and social problem which the government had the strongest interest in settling. The interest of the State demanded a compromise, affirming enough to escape being merely negative, but not so much as to adopt a clear-cut position. Unfortunately the policy of
compromise presupposed that the Arian theology of

144 The Arian Controversy after the Council ofNicaea
Eudoxius and his friends was a tolerable form o f Christianity, and this was a proposition to which Basil o f Ancyra, to say nothing of Athanasius, could not agree. Accordingly Con­ stantius was forced into persecuting those who were un­ willing to tolerate Arianism. They happened to believe that it was fundamentally false, and their conscience made them prefer exile or even martyrdom rather than bend their will to a course of political expediency.
These considerations help to explain why it was only at this stage ofthe Arian controversy that the really serious and hard thinking began to be done. Those who rejected the Arian theology had to show with reasoned arguments that the 'orthodox’ alternative was true. Paradoxically this was a matter to which relatively litde attention had been paid before the fifties of the fourth century. The controversy, it is true, had not simply consisted o f shouting rival anathemas and slogans. In 344 the Eastern leaders had produced a long
and sober statement of their theology, intended to instruct the West about the underlying issues. On the Nicene side Athanasius produced a number of tracts, especially from about 350 onwards, full of theological explanations of the anti-Arian case. Even so it was not until the late fifties that the thinking became strenuous, partly under the impulse of Basil ofAncyra. At Rome the conversion ofthe Neoplatonist Marius Victorinus brought into the controversy on the Nicene side an acute philosophical mind.In 360 Athanasius
realized that Basil ofAncyra and he were basically fighting for the same cause, and held out a proposal o f an alliance even if Basil and his friends retained their scruples about the keyword of the Nicene formula, ‘identical in essence* (,homoousios): ‘Those who accept the Nicene creed but have doubts about the term homoousios must not be treated as enemies; we discuss the matter with them as brothers with brothers; they mean the same as we, and dispute only about the word.’ The eirenic words introduce Athanasius* longest and best discussion of the meaning of the Nicene formula. The rapprochement, though the kiss of death for the party of Basil of Ancyra, was to contribute much to the ultimate defeat of Arianism. But the hour of triumph had to wait

twenty years until there was an emperor in the East ready to carry it through.

But after arriving at Constantinople
(November 380), Theodosius’ attitude was soon changed by better information. He saw that the one man capable of
150 The Arian Controversy after the Council o f Nicaea
rallying the Greek bishops to a united front was Meletius of Antiooh, and that Paulinus must be tacitly abandoned.
In May 381 Theodosius summoned a large ‘ecumenical* council to Constantinople, and it is a sign o f the sea-change in his understanding of the problems that he made Meletius its president. No representatives came from Rome. The new bishop ofAlexandria, Timothy, arrived reluctantly and late. The council had to decide about the succession at Constan­ tinople, where the Arian Demophilus had withdrawn before the Theodosian wind o f change. A t first the council appoin­ ted Gregory of Nazianzus to be bishop of Constantinople, and it seemed a suitable appointment: he was an eloquent preacher and an intelligent defender of the Nicene cause. But during the council Meletius died, and when Gregory advocated the recognition of Paulinus as his successor at Antioch on the ground that it would conciliate the West, a storm followed to which Gregory was unequal. Technical objections were brought against the validity of Gregory’s own translation from Sasima to Constantinople; had not the Nicene canons forbidden translations? Gregory retired in distress to Cappadocia, where he wrote a self-pitying auto­ biography in iambic verse. The council then had to decide the succession for both Antioch and Constantinople. For Antioch they chose one of Meletius* clergy, Flavian, For Constantinople they chose a distinguished government official, Nectarius, who was so free of past association with any party in the controversy that he had not even been bap­ tized, and was consecrated bishop immediately after bap­ tism. It was not without precedent for an upper-class layman to be promoted bishop without passing through the dia­ conate and presbyterate; but such sudden preferments were disliked by the clergy and had been deplored by synods.
The council reaffirmed the Nicene faith in the sense that it reasserted the Nicene keyword ‘ identical in essence* homoousios). But the actual creed promulgated by the coun­ cil was differently worded from that of Nicaea, and had a cautiously worded article concerning the Holy Spirit. This reflected the argument ofBasil ofCaesarea that in the liturgy the Holy Spirit is worshipped and glorified together with

FromJulian to Tkeodosiui I 151
the Father and the Son, and that the difference between the Son and the Spirit is to be seen in that while the Son is ‘ begotten of the Father,’ the Holy Spirit ‘proceeds from the Father \ Although the council condemned Apollinarianism and Macedonianism, it wrote no clauses into its creed which the Apollinarians and Macedonians could not accept.
Finally the council agreed on a fateful canon: ‘ the bishop o f Constantinople shall have rank after the bishop o f Rome because it is New Rome*. This canon was resented both at Alexandria, long regarded as the second city of the empire, and at Rome because, although it conceded that Rome was the first see o f Christendom, it implied that Roman p r i m a r y depended on the city’s secular standing.
The West fought a long struggle against this canon, against Nectarius* appointment, and against the council’s refusal to recognize Paulinus of Antioch. But the doctrinal decisions of the council marked the end of the Arian attempt to capture the church o f the empire. Arianism lived On among the Goths, who had been converted by Arian missionaries - especiallybyUlfila (c.311-83), translatoroftheGothicBible, himselfa Visigoth1who had been consecrated as missionary bishop in 341 by Eusebius of Nicomedia (below, p. 249). But within the empire Arianism died unloved and unlamented. The surviving fragments ofthe Arian historian Philostorgius, who wrote an apology for Arianism about 425, show how the movement which had begun as a bold endeavour to re­ formulate Christian doctrine in a way more palatable to the educated public ofa .d . 320, sadly ended in die superstitious repetition of antiquated slogans.
